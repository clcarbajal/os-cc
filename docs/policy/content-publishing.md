# Content Publishing Policy 

## Publishing content at Flexpa. 

Flexpa is creating a new market in the healthcare industry and it's our responsibility to share our expertise with the rest of the world. Content creation comes in various forms from simple blog posts, one-pagers, white papers, infographics, tweets, LinkedIn posts, and even recorded demos and video notes. 

This document contains the steps that everyone should follow as they contribute to the Flexpa online archives.

## What type of content does this policy apply to? 
- Blog posts 
- Press releases 
- Tweets 
- Linkedin Posts 
- Email blasts and newsletters 
- Case studies 

## I want to write or publish one of the above, what do I do? 
The author of the piece is responsible for coordinating everything leading up to publishing. Once you feel that your content is ready to be published, consider the following questions: 

## Does this require legal review? Consider if there is any mention or reference to the management of PHI? HIPAA? End-user processes?  

- Are we name dropping any large customers or industry whales? If so, would the tone or content within the article, etc. upset any of their stakeholders?
- Have they reviewed and approved the piece? 
- Does the article, etc align with the Flexpa brand guidelines? Might be worth asking our Head of Design &/or co-founders if any graphics or visuals meet branding expectations.

If you are unsure, reach out to COO or CoS for a quick review. 

## Iâ€™m ready to publish. How do I push to prod? 
Any and all work produced within your scope of work and behalf of Flexpa is property of Flexpa per our standard letter of employment and must therefore be shared from official company accounts. Flexpa is happy to give authorship rights to content creators however Flexpa itself shall retain all ownership rights.
